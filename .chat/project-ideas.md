# SharePoint Framework Project Ideas

**User**: I'd like to have a few things that I have ideas:
1. Incorporate interactive dashboards/views from OpenProject directly on the page
2. Add javascript/css to the page to customize the look and feel of the sharepoint site/brand/appearance
3. Add an AI bot popup on the bottom right that persists throughout the page
4. Embed a given Teams channel on the page
5. Integrate with Synergis adept (lower priority)

**AI**: Here's how we can implement each of these ideas using SharePoint Framework:

## 1. OpenProject Dashboard Integration

**Implementation Approach:**

- Authenticate using OAuth or API tokens
- Fetch project data and render dashboards/views using React
- Implement interactive filters and refresh capabilities

**Key Components:**
- API connection service to OpenProject
- Dashboard rendering component with configurable views
- Caching mechanism for performance optimization

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Research OpenProject API documentation
2. Create an SPFx React webpart
3. Implement authentication with the OpenProject API
4. Create dashboard components to display the data
5. Add configuration options to select different views

## 2. Custom SharePoint Branding

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create an Application Customizer extension (SPFx extension)
- Inject custom CSS/JS into all pages of a SharePoint site
- Implement theme customization options

**Key Components:**
- Header and footer customizers

4. Implement theme switching functionality
5. Add responsive design elements for different devices

## 3. AI Bot Popup Integration

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create an Application Customizer extension for site-wide presence
- Integrate with Azure Bot Service or another AI chatbot platform
- Create a floating UI element that persists across page navigation

**Key Components:**
- Bot framework integration
- Collapsible/expandable UI component
- Context-aware suggestions based on current page
- Chat history storage

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Set up Azure Bot Service or chosen AI platform
2. Create an SPFx Extension
3. Develop the bot UI component
4. Implement communication with the bot service
5. Add user preference storage for persistence

## 4. Teams Channel Embedding

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create an SPFx webpart using Microsoft Graph API
- Embed specific Teams channel conversations
- Implement authentication and permission handling

**Key Components:**
- Microsoft Graph API integration
- Teams conversation rendering component
- Configuration panel for channel selection

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Register an app in Azure AD for Microsoft Graph access

3. Implement Microsoft Graph authentication
4. Develop UI components to display Teams conversations
5. Add functionality to post and interact with the channel

## 5. Synergis Adept Integration

**Implementation Approach:**
- Research Synergis Adept API/SDK capabilities
- Create an SPFx webpart for document management integration
- Implement search and retrieval functionality

**Key Components:**
