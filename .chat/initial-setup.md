# Initial SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Project Setup

**User**: Can you help me set up a development environment for SPFx to create some webparts and custom elements that will improve sharepoint online for my team? I'd like to set up a github repo to manage my code (not set up yet). I'm new to the framework, and a novice programmer, so hopefully you can assist. I'd also like to periodically save our conversations in a .chat folder in the root directory that will give context to future AI conversations. Additionally, I'd like to have periodic 'instruction' files or readme documents for AI to review (indexed via cursor).

**AI**: I'll help you set up a development environment for SharePoint Framework (SPFx) and guide you through the setup process. I've created:

1. A README.md file with project information and setup instructions
2. A setup guide (docs/setup-guide.md) with detailed instructions for SPFx development
3. AI instructions (docs/ai-instructions.md) to provide context for future AI interactions
4. This conversation history file (.chat/initial-setup.md)

The next steps for setting up your SPFx development environment are:

1. Install the prerequisites mentioned in the setup guide:
   - Node.js LTS version
   - Yeoman and the SPFx generator
   - Gulp CLI

2. Initialize your SPFx project using the Yeoman generator
3. Set up your GitHub repository
4. Install dependencies and test the local workbench

Would you like me to provide more specific instructions for any of these steps?
